### Code explanation for the exercises:

The code demonstrates several operations on arrays using different methods in JavaScript. It starts by logging each name in the names array and each province in the provinces array using the forEach method. Then, it utilizes the map method to convert each province name to uppercase, and another map operation to calculate the length of each name, resulting in a new array. Next, it creates a sorted array of provinces alphabetically by employing the spread operator with the sort method. Filtering out provinces containing the word "Cape" is achieved using the filter method. Additionally, a boolean array is generated to indicate whether each name contains the letter 'S' using a combination of map and some methods. Lastly, the code transforms the names and provinces arrays into an object mapping each name to its corresponding province using the reduce method. Overall, these operations showcase the versatility and power of array methods in JavaScript for data manipulation and transformation.

### For the advanced exercises

The code encapsulates various operations on a list of products into an object. It handles tasks like getting product names, filtering products based on name length, computing the total price, joining product names, identifying the highest and lowest-priced items, and restructuring the product data. To calculate the total price, it ignores products without prices, converts price strings into numbers, and adds them up. For identifying the highest and lowest-priced items, it removes products with invalid prices, extracts prices, finds the highest and lowest values, and formats the result. Lastly, for restructuring products, it creates a new array of objects with 'name' and 'cost' attributes. This code illustrates practical usage of JavaScript array methods for data manipulation and processing, with clear comments explaining each step.

### Challenges 
Not so much challenges were faced in this project, I was just practicing my javascript and implementing the content I already learnt. I am now grasping how to read code and make sense of it.
